# Spleunky Leaderboard Website

This project is a website to store me and my friend's runs for the game Speleunky 2. I used PHP, mySQL and Materialize for the website.

The project features:
- A global leaderboard with clickable headers to sort by (SQL)
- A login system using sessions
- Encrypted passwords
- Personal statistics page
- Ability to interact with the database by adding/deleting runs, creating an account, displaying content, etc
- Knowledge of PHPMyAdmin, table relations
- Input validation with regex
- Use of AJAX
 
## How to install/run

Click the Admin button on XAMPP of mySQL, create a new database and then import records.sql in the root directory. For online webhosts,
the instructions vary.
